The trooper and the civilian \"ride-along\", a 20-year-old college freshman, observed a vehicle stop several feet before the toll booth on the 836 Expressway. After Trooper Glascock pulled up behind the car, the driver pulled through the toll booth without paying. Trooper Glascock stopped the vehicle, and as he was getting out, the suspect began backing up. Trooper Glascock backed his vehicle up to avoid a collision. This happened several times, and at that point, Trooper Glascock told his ride-along that he intended to arrest the suspect. Trooper Glascock and the suspect both exited their vehicles and exchanged words. The suspect then fled back to his vehicle, where he retrieved a .38-caliber handgun and shot Trooper Glascock twice, killing him. The suspect then entered his vehicle. The ride-along unlocked the 12-gauge shotgun that was mounted in the patrol car, loaded it, and opened fire at the suspect. The suspect sped away, but not before the ride-along was able to fire four shots, wounding him. The ride-along then radioed for help. Trooper Glascock was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. A massive manhunt ensued. Working with the description that the ride-along provided, along with a partial license plate of the suspect's vehicle, the police were able to identify the suspect. During the investigation, the suspect’s vehicle was recovered along with the 38-caliber Titen revolver used to kill the trooper. Roadblocks were set up all over Miami, and after two days, the suspect turned himself in because he was unable to get out of town. The 31-year-old suspect pled guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. He was denied parole in 2011 and again in 2017. As of November 23, 2020, he was in prison. Trooper Glascock's murder spurred the state cabinet to buy bullet-resistant vests for all state troopers. Trooper Glascock had served with the Florida Highway Patrol for one year. He was survived by his parents, brother, and sister."

He stopped to assist the motorist whose vehicle had become stuck on a swale. He had positioned his patrol car behind the vehicle and completed paperwork for approximately one hour while the motorist waited for a tow truck to remove the vehicle. During this time Trooper Bullock had several normal interactions with the motorist. Once the tow truck driver arrived the man became upset with the cost of having the vehicle towed. He calmly walked back to Trooper Bullock’s vehicle and, without warning, drew a handgun and fatally shot him in the head. The man then attempted to shoot the tow truck driver, but his gun jammed, allowing the tow truck driver to run to safety. The tow truck driver was able to get the attention of an off-duty Riviera Beach detective who was driving into work. The detective fatally shot the subject after the man confronted him and pointed the gun at him. Trooper Bullock was a U.S. Air Force veteran and had served with the Florida Highway Patrol for 19 years. He is survived by his parents and two sisters. In December 2020, the Port Salerno post office was renamed the Trooper Joseph Bullock Building and I-95, where he was shot, was also renamed Trooper Joseph Bullock Memorial Highway."

Consent was given to search the vehicle, during which Trooper Young discovered a substantial amount of cocaine. The amount was later determined to be 340 grams of crack cocaine. A violent struggle between the Trooper and suspects ensued, and one of the suspects gained control of Trooper Young's revolver and shot him in the face at point-blank range. The 42-year-old shooter and his 40-year-old accomplice were apprehended three hours later in a nearby swamp. The shooter was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. As of November 28, 2020, now 75, he remains on death row. Trooper Young served with the Florida Highway Patrol for three years and was assigned to Troop F.

Captain Chad Reed was shot and killed in a shootout with a man wanted for murdering two elderly women and shooting two other women in Hernando County. Following the shootings and murders, the Hernando County Sheriff's Office put out an alert for the suspect and his vehicle. The vehicle was spotted in Dixie County and deputies began to follow it with the intention of stopping it in a rural area once it passed through town. The driver of the vehicle suddenly pulled into a gas station and then opened fire on the deputies. Captain Reed and the suspect were both wounded during the shooting. Both men were transported to Shands Hospital, where Captain Reed succumbed to his wounds. On February 10, 2011, the subject pled guilty of murder in the first degree in connection with Captain Reed's death and was sentenced to life in prison. In January 2012 the man was also convicted of two additional murders and subsequently sentenced to death. He died in 2015. Captain Reed had served with the Dixie County Sheriff's Office for 13 years and was a graduate of the 238th session of the FBI National Academy. He is survived by his wife and two children."

He had just finished a traffic stop on I-95 and was completing paperwork when the crash occurred. Shortly after impact, his cruiser burst into flames, and he burned to death after being trapped inside. The 21-year-old driver who caused the crash was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in Florida State Prison. On August 13, 2010, with less than a year left in prison, he was in a work release program and failed to return to prison at the end of his shift. He was found sitting on a park bench in his urine in a very intoxicated condition. Trooper Smith had served with the Florida Highway Patrol for five years. He is survived by his wife, son, daughter, parents, and brother, who also served in law enforcement. Between 1985 and 1989, Trooper Smith was a pitcher for the Minnesota Twins. In each of the previous four years, he had made over 100 DUI arrests. In 2000 Governor Jeb Bush signed the Trooper Robert Smith bill into law, allowing judges to keep drunk drivers in jail until their trial."

The suspect produced a handgun and struck Corporal Roberts several times before shooting him once the chest. The round struck him in an area not protected by his vest. Corporal Roberts' sergeant pulled up as the man began to flee. The man then pulled an AR-15 rifle from his shopping basket, pointed it at the sergeant, and then fled on foot. The sergeant then provided aid to Corporal Roberts by calling for backup. Officers from Corporal Roberts' squad performed CPR until the paramedics arrived, and he was transported to Tampa General Hospital, where he succumbed to his wounds. The suspect, a former U.S. Virgin Islands police officer, surrendered a short time later after being located by a canine unit. He was armed with three handguns and a rifle when he was taken into custody. On November 15, 2011, the suspect was convicted of first-degree murder in connection with Officer Roberts' murder and was sentenced to death on February 10, 2012. The Florida Supreme Court later reduced the sentence to life without parole.

Deputies had responded to an apartment complex nearby after a man started throwing furniture and clothing off his balcony. A short time later, the man disrobed and started throwing food at neighbors. The man attacked responding deputies, striking one of them multiple times in the head. Attempts to stop the attack with electric control weapons failed. The subject broke free, got into a car, and drove through a closed gate. The man intentionally drove across multiple lanes of traffic and struck Sergeant LaVigne's patrol car on the driver's door at a high rate of speed. Deputies were unable to free Sergeant LaVigne, and he had to be extricated by rescue units. He was transported to Tampa General Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. The subject was arrested following the collision. In 2025, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 45 years. Sergeant LaVigne had served with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office for thirty years and was killed the day before his last scheduled shift before retirement. He previously served with the Largo Police Department prior to joining the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. He is survived by his wife and two children.
